NERDTree is a file explorer plugin that provides "project drawer" functionality to your vim editing. You can learn more about it with `:help NERDTree`.

<b>QuickStart</b> Launch using `<c-e>`

### <a href="https://github.com/mbbill/undotree">undotree</a>
<hr>
If you undo changes and then make a new change, in most editors the changes you undid are gone forever, as their undo-history is a simple list. Since version 7.0 vim uses an undo-tree instead. If you make a new change after undoing changes, a new branch is created in that tree. Combined with persistent undo, this is nearly as flexible and safe as git ;-)
Undotree makes that feature more accessible by creating a visual representation of said undo-tree

<b> QuickStart</b> Launch using `<Leader>u`.

<hr>
Syntastic is a syntax checking plugin that runs buffers through external syntax checkers as they are saved and opened. If syntax errors are detected, the user is notified and is happy because they didn't have to compile their code or execute their script to find them.

### <a href="https://github.com/townk/vim-autoclose">autoclose</a>
<hr>
AutoClose does what you expect. It's simple, if you open a bracket, paren, brace, quote, etc, it automatically closes it. It handles curlys correctly and doesn't get in the way of double curlies for things like jinja and twig.
